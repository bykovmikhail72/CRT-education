# CRT-education

Hello. This is my repo, where I will post my homework as a part of a React course by Crt.school.

My name is Mikhail and I study web-development. It`s very interesting and very nessesary for me. Now my specialization is auto electric, but I believe that I will become a realy good specialist of a web-development. My dream is working in CRT!

My first homework today, 30.07.22, is learning GIT. Here I must to create a new branch, named "lesson/GIT" and create file "README".
